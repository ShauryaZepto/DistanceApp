# Problem Statement
We are given two floating point coordinates and we need to calculate the distance between the given points

# Working
The Program takes four inputs (the coordiantes of the points) as x1 y1 and x2 y2 and outputs the distance between the two given points in float64 format

# Running the Code 
To Run the code simply go to the project directory run ```go run cmd/app/main.go```

# Testing
To test the functions run ```go test ./...```
